- 👋 Hello world, I’m Toni Bertólez!
- 👀 I’m a PhD student in neutrino physics at the Institute of Cosmic Sciences of the Universitat de Barcelona (ICCUB).
- 🌱 I try to combine theory with experiments in a phenomenological approach and thus I code in Python, Fortran and a bit of C.
- 💞️ So, be advised, my codes are not really optimized, but simply do what they must do. I want to learn how to write code better, but time is limited!
- 📫 You may reach me at antoni.bertolez@fqa.ub.edu!
